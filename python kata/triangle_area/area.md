ASK 10: 
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the base and height of a triangle and returns its area.
Once you learn functions,revisit this and write this code inside a function.

### BDD
- Get user input (base and height)
- Calculate based on the inputs 
- Return the are as the result

### Pseudo code
-Create a function:
- prompt for height & base then store in variables
- convert to float for manipulation
- Calculate 
- Return response
