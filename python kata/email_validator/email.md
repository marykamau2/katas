#Write a program which accepts email as form input or from terminal. Validate the email by checking if it contains an “@” symbol and “.” symbol.
- Hint: In Python you can use the string split method e.g my_email.split(“@”) or my_email(“@”)
#Once you learn functions, revisit this and write this code inside a function.
## BDD
 -Expected input from user-email.
   example
  age@gmail.com -Expected output-valid email
 ambergmail.com-Expected output-invalid email
## pseudcode
-define function that validates an email,
-create a variable -my email to accept and store input,
-create an if condition to check if the email is valid by using the split method,and store the value in a variable (email)
-returns the variable
