- Implement a program that takes 3 form inputs or from the terminal, and stores them in three variables. Return the largest of the three. Do this without using the the inbuilt max () function!
- The goal of this exercise is to think about some internals that programs normally take care of for us.
- Extras:
- If the number is a multiple of 4, display out a different message.
- Once you learn functions,revisit this and write this code inside a function.

## BDD
 -take 3 numbers from user,(user input)
 -place numbers in a list
 -sort the list -ranging(index 0-3)
 -pop out last no. of the list
## pseudcode
-define the function to find largest number,
-declare variables to hold the list,
-implement  a for-loop that add items in a list
-Sort list
-Access the largest index in list
